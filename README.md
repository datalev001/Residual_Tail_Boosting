# Residual-Tail Boosting: A Fast Post-Training Add-On for Extra Accuracy in Tree Ensembles
A Practical Error-Correction Method Using Adaptive Residual Deltas with Minimal Compute
Traditional boosters such as XGBoost often plateau once their built‑in update rule can no longer spot useful signals. Residual‑Tail Boosting (RTB) picks up from there: when the head model stops improving, a lightweight "tail" learner targets the remaining errors and applies a final adjustment. Think of it as a second pair of eyes - quick, inexpensive, and focused only on what the main model overlooked.
I provide two tail variants. The Ada‑tail converts each residual to a binary flag and fits a small set of weighted stumps, while the Residual‑tree tail retains the full signed residual and lets a shallow decision tree trim it over a few iterations. Ada is one option; any compact learner - a tiny neural net, k‑nearest neighbors, or a linear rule - can slot into the same residual‑tuning loop. Whatever the choice, the routine is identical: collect residuals, predict a delta, and blend it with a step size chosen on validation data.
RTB works straight out of the box. I can attach any forecasting "head" to any "tail" that produces probabilities or numbers. Adding it takes only a few lines of code, doesn't disturb the  existing training setup, and tracks which tails actually help. Tests on real-world data show reliable accuracy gains - proving that a well-chosen tail can push an ensemble beyond its usual limit.
